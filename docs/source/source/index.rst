Lectures
--------
4:30 â€” 5:45

Joyce Cummings Center 160

Zoom coordinates to be published over Piazza.

The preferred mode of attending lectures is synchronous, in person, in order to be able to participate in class discussions.
However, attending in person for students who are out of state or in another country is not possible. Lectures will be available via Zoom for students who can not attend in person.

Lecture recordings are available in case you had an unplanned absence. Recordings are not an adequate substitute for being there, however.

To make zoom recordings available for your unexpected absences, please be aware that you are consenting to being recorded. If you have objections to being recorded, please contact me before class.
